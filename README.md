# Laravel Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol
A Laravel package to use [Measurement Protocol for Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4).

## Introduction
This package allows you to post events to Google Analytics 4 from your Laravel backend.

## Supported Laravel versions
- Laravel 7.x
- Laravel 8.x
- Laravel 9.x
- Laravel 10.x
- Laravel 11.x
- Laravel 12.x

## Installation
1) Install the package by running this command in your terminal/cmd:
```bash
composer require freshbitsweb/laravel-google-analytics-4-measurement-protocol
```

2) Set `MEASUREMENT_ID` and `MEASUREMENT_PROTOCOL_API_SECRET` in your .env file.
You can get them from: Google Analytics > Admin > Data Streams > [Select Site] > Measurement Protocol API secrets

3) Optional: You can publish the config file by running this command in your terminal/cmd:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=google-analytics-4-measurement-protocol-config
```

4) `client_id` is required to post an event to Google Analytics. This package provides a Blade component which you can put in your layout file after the Google Analytics Code tracking code. It makes a POST request to the backend to store the client id in the session which is later used to post events to Google Analytics 4.

```html
<!-- Google Analytics Code -->
<x-google-analytics-client-id />
<!-- </head> -->
```

The other option is to call the `setClientId($clientId)` method on the `GA4` facade everytime before calling the `postEvent()` method.

## Usage

You can simple call `GA4::postEvent($eventData)` from anywhere in your backend to post event to Google Analytics 4. `$eventData` contains the name and params of the event as per this [reference page](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference/events#login). For example:

```php
GA4::postEvent([
    'name' => 'login',
    'params' => [
        'method' => 'Google',
    ],
]);
```

`postEvent()` method will return an array with the status of the request.

### Debugging Mode

You can also enable [debugging mode](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/validating-events) by calling `enableDebugging()` method before calling the `postEvent()` method. Like so - `GA4::enableDebugging()->postEvent($eventData)`. The `postEvent()` method will return the response (array) from Google Analytics request in that case.
